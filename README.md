🧠 FleetTrack ∞ — Sovereign Intelligence Cockpit (SIC)

FleetTrack ∞ is a sovereign-grade fleet orchestration engine that fuses simulation, prediction, compliance, and training into a unified cockpit. Designed for government and enterprise deployment, it anticipates threats, optimizes dispatch, and certifies every decision with audit-grade traceability.

🚀 Features
- CenturionGrid1000: Simulates 1000 cognition cores across 20 domains (route, fuel, fatigue, threat, etc.)
- FleetQ Prediction Feed: Live visualization of top actions per domain with confidence scores
- DispatchOptimizer: Recalculates routes, loads, and schedules for SLA compliance
- DriverFatigueEstimator: Flags fatigue risk using telemetry and trip history
- FleetStressMonitor: Monitors systemic strain across vehicles, drivers, and dispatch corridors
- IncidentEscalationProtocols: Simulates enforcement, lockdown, and recovery flows
- Student Co-Pilot Console: Onboards and certifies drivers with simulations and progress tracking
- Audit-Grade Export Engine: Generates log sheets, dispatch certs, receipts, and compliance documents with full mutation trace

🧾 Compliance & Certification
- Government and enterprise-ready export flows
- Timestamped documents with logo, remarks, and audit trail
- Stripe receipt sync and dispatch certificate generator
- FleetTrack ∞ Core Manual for onboarding and institutional training

📦 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Routing: React Router
- Visualization: Leaflet + MarkerCluster
- Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Styling: TailwindCSS + cockpit-grade semantic polish

🧠 Architecture
FleetTrack ∞ is modular, auditable, and mutation-safe. Every component is designed for sovereign deployment:
- /cockpit/dashboard: Core visualization and prediction feed
- /cockpit/student: Training, certification, and onboarding flows
- /engine: CenturionGrid1000 simulation logic
- /exports: PDF wrappers, audit trail embedding, and compliance certs
