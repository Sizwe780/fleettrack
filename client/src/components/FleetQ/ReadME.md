# CoreEngine — FleetCoreQuantumX ∞

## Purpose
This module governs sovereign cognition through quantum entanglement logic, recursive mutation, ethical vetoes, and causal reversal. It serves as the ethical and computational backbone of FleetCoreQuantumX ∞.

## Capabilities
- Quantum state simulation and collapse vector generation
- Recursive mutation with depth control
- Semantic trace fusion and domain dispatch
- Cancer resolution and lottery pattern anticipation
- Causal reversal and hidden law extraction
- DOI-ready insight packaging and audit trail logging

## Integration
This module interfaces with:
- `QuantumSim.py` for entanglement modeling
- `FleetTrack.py` for timestamping and mutation chaining
- `SovereignAPI.py` for external exposure and monetization
